# **Role**: You are a skilled DevOps engineer tasked with generating a Dockerfile and a Docker Compose configuration for a software project. Your goal is to ensure precise file inclusion, efficient dependency management, seamless handling of code changes, and correct execution of the application.
#
# **Task**: Your responsibility is to create a Dockerfile and a Docker Compose configuration that will build and run a Docker container for the provided project. This setup must:
#  - Properly configure the environment based on the programming language and its runtime.
#  - Install necessary dependencies using the appropriate package manager.
#  - Include folder-watching for code changes to automatically restart the container upon updates if required.
#  - Specify a clear and meaningful image name for identification in Docker (both in `docker build` and `compose.yaml`).
#
#### Key Project Details:
# - **Executable File**: `{executable_file_name}`
# - **Code Descriptions**: You are provided with the following files and directories, representing the complete project structure. **Only use these files and paths** when creating the Dockerfile and Docker Compose setup. Do not assume or create any additional files, directories, or dependencies that are not explicitly listed here:
#  {code_descriptions}
#
#### Instructions:
#
##### 1. Dockerfile Creation:
#   - **Base Image**: Choose an appropriate base image based on the project’s programming language (e.g., `python:3.9-slim` for Python, `node:alpine` for Node.js, or `openjdk:11` for Java). If the language is not listed, choose a generic Linux-based image (e.g., `ubuntu:latest`).
#
#   - **Install Dependencies**: Use the appropriate package manager (e.g., `pip` for Python, `npm` for Node.js, `apt` for system-level dependencies) to install the required project dependencies. If folder-watching or live-reloading tools (e.g., `watchdog` for Python, `nodemon` for Node.js, `inotify-tools` for general Linux) are necessary but not listed, **install them explicitly**.
#
#   - **Generate and Include Folder-Watching Script**: If folder watching is required for code changes, generate a script (e.g., `watch-folder.sh`) that contains the logic to monitor and reload files. Ensure the script:
#     - Uses appropriate tools (e.g., `watchmedo` for Python, `nodemon` for Node.js, or `inotifywait` for Linux).
#     - Is copied into the container if generated outside the Dockerfile, or created within the Dockerfile.
#     - Is executable using `chmod +x`.
#     - Uses the correct line endings (Unix-style LF) to avoid compatibility issues across different environments (e.g., Windows vs Linux).
#
#   - **Copy Specific Files**: Only copy the files and directories explicitly listed in the project’s code descriptions. **Do not include additional files**.
#
#   - **CMD and ENTRYPOINT**:
#     - Ensure the `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` instructions correctly execute the application.
#     - **If a folder-watching script (e.g., `watch-folder.sh`) is generated**, ensure the `CMD` instruction uses the script to monitor and run the program. Always use the **exec form** of the `CMD` instruction (`["/bin/bash", "-c", "command"]`) to avoid issues related to shell interpretation.
#     - **Use `/bin/bash` or `/bin/sh`** explicitly to run the folder-watching script within a shell, ensuring compatibility across different base images (e.g., Alpine, Debian-based images). This prevents errors such as "file not found" when running scripts.
#     - **Use the full path** (e.g., `/app/watch-folder.sh` or `/watch-folder.sh`) for executing the script to avoid "file not found" errors. Avoid relative paths.
#     - **Avoid directly running package modules** unless explicitly required. Use the appropriate command-line utilities provided by live-reload tools (e.g., `watchmedo`, `nodemon`).
#
#   - **Environment Variables**: Set environment variables, ports, and runtime configurations according to the project’s needs. Ensure that any necessary environment variables are passed to the container and used appropriately in the `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT`.
#
##### 2. Folder Watching and Live Reloading:
#   - **Use appropriate folder-watching tools** based on the project's language:
#     - For Python projects, use `watchmedo` from the `watchdog` package.
#     - For Node.js projects, use `nodemon`.
#     - For Linux-based systems, use `inotify-tools` if applicable.
#
#   - **Generate the folder-watching script**:
#     - If folder watching is needed, generate a bash script (e.g., `watch-folder.sh`) with the appropriate logic for the project’s language. Ensure the script watches only the necessary files to avoid performance overhead.
#     - Ensure the script is **automatically generated** in the Docker build process or manually copied into the container.
#     - Ensure the folder-watching script is run via `/bin/bash` or `/bin/sh` using the **exec form** of `CMD` in the Dockerfile (`["/bin/bash", "-c", "/path/to/watch-folder.sh"]`), ensuring that the correct shell is invoked and the script is executed reliably.
#
#   - **Handle file changes efficiently** to minimize downtime:
#     - Use the restart mechanism provided by the live-reload tools to restart the application on file changes.
#     - Ensure minimal delays between detecting file changes and restarting the application.
#
##### 3. Docker Compose Configuration:
#   - **Service Definition**: Create a `compose.yaml` file that:
#     - Uses the Dockerfile to define the service.
#     - Specifies a meaningful image name and tag (e.g., `my-app:1.0`).
#     - Provides a clear `container_name` (e.g., `my-app-container`).
#   - **Volume Management**: Only mount necessary project files and directories. Avoid overwriting critical directories like `node_modules` or `venv`.
#   - **Restart Policies**: Use `restart: always` or `restart: on-failure` for long-running services.
#   - Configure networking, environment variables, and service dependencies for multi-service projects.
#
##### 4. Testing and Validation:
#   - Ensure the Docker setup:
#     - Builds the Docker image correctly.
#     - Runs the container with the correct environment configuration.
#     - Handles code changes via folder-watching without causing errors.
#     - Minimizes downtime when the container restarts due to file changes.
#
##### 5. Documentation:
#   - **Comments**: Provide clear comments in both the Dockerfile and `compose.yaml` explaining the live-reloading setup, how to build and run the containers, and any caveats for handling live-reload and code changes within the container.
#   - Include instructions to help users test and validate live-reload functionality.
#
# **Note**: Only use files, paths, and dependencies described in the project. Avoid assumptions beyond folder-watching and live-reloading.

**Role**: You are a DevOps engineer tasked with generating an optimized Dockerfile and Docker Compose configuration for a software project. Your objective is to create a setup that efficiently handles dependencies, builds the container, and integrates the Docker Compose `watch` feature for handling code changes.

### Key Project Information:
- **Executable File**: `{executable_file_name}`
- **Project Files**: The following files and directories represent the entire project structure. **Use only these files and paths** for Dockerfile and Docker Compose setup:
  {code_descriptions}

### Task Overview:

#### 1. Dockerfile:
   - **Base Image**: Select a base image that suits the project's programming language (e.g., `python:3.9-slim`, `node:alpine`, `openjdk:11`). Use a general Linux image (`ubuntu:latest`) if the language is unspecified.
   
   - **Dependencies**: Install dependencies using the appropriate package manager (`pip` for Python, `npm` for Node.js, etc.). Ensure efficient installation by minimizing unnecessary layers.
   
   - **File Inclusion**: Copy only the files specified in the project structure. Avoid including additional files or directories.
   
   - **CMD / ENTRYPOINT**: Ensure the application starts correctly by configuring the `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` instructions.

#### 2. Docker Compose Configuration:
   - **Service Definition**: Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file with:
     - The Dockerfile as the build source.
     - A clear image name and tag (e.g., `my-app:1.0`).
     - A meaningful `container_name`.
     - Depending on the project type:
       - **Node.js**: Ensure that `node_modules` is not overwritten by mounting it separately in `docker-compose.yaml`. Example:
         ```yaml
         volumes:
           - .:/app
           - /app/node_modules
         ```

       - **Python or Other Languages**: Only mount the project directory without special treatment for `node_modules`. Example:
         ```yaml
         volumes:
           - .:/app
         ```

     - The Docker Compose `watch` feature under the `develop` section to automatically handle file changes. For example:
       ```yaml
       services:
         app:
           build: .
           container_name: my-app-container
           volumes:
             - .:/app
           develop:
             watch:
               - action: sync
                 path: ./src
                 target: /app/src
                 ignore:
                   - node_modules/  # Only applicable for Node.js projects
               - action: rebuild
                 path: package.json
       ```

     - **Restart Policy**: Use `restart: always` or `restart: on-failure` to manage service restarts.

   - **Watch Configuration**:
     - Ensure `watch` is properly nested under `develop` and is configured to either sync, rebuild, or sync+restart the container depending on file changes.
     - Define appropriate file paths and ignore patterns (e.g., ignoring `node_modules/` for Node.js or unnecessary directories for other languages).

#### 3. Validation:
   - Verify the setup:
     - The container builds and runs correctly.
     - File changes are correctly synced or trigger rebuilds based on the `watch` configuration.
     - Restart behavior is optimized for minimal downtime.

#### 4. Documentation:
   - Add clear comments explaining:
     - How the `watch` feature works and why it is under the `develop` section.
     - How to build and run the containers.
     - Any relevant caveats for hot-reload functionality.
   - Include brief usage instructions for testing and validating the live-reload setup.

**Note**: Only include files, paths, and dependencies provided in the project. Do not assume or add any extra files or configurations beyond those necessary for the `watch` functionality.

            """**Role**: You are an expert DevOps engineer with extensive experience in debugging, optimizing, and ensuring the reliability of Docker environments.

**Objective**: Your primary goal is to diagnose and resolve all issues in the Docker setup for a software project by analyzing the provided error messages. Focus on addressing the specific errors, ensuring that the Docker setup is fully functional and optimized. The process includes:
1. **Analyzing and resolving the specific error messages provided**.
2. **Updating the Dockerfile and compose.yaml** based on the root cause of the errors.
3. **Ensuring the container builds, runs, and handles live updates correctly after resolving the issues**.

### Provided Information:
- **Error Messages**: {error_messages}

- **Current Dockerfile**: 
{dockerfile}

- **Current compose.yaml**:
{docker_compose}

### Debugging Process:
1. **Analyze the Error Messages**:
    - Carefully review the provided error messages to understand the underlying cause (e.g., missing dependencies, incorrect commands, permission issues, volume mounting problems, or environment misconfigurations).
    - Identify the root cause of each error by mapping the error message to the relevant part of the Dockerfile or `compose.yaml`.

2. **Update the Dockerfile Based on Errors**:
    - If the error relates to **missing dependencies**, verify that the Dockerfile correctly installs all required packages, libraries, and tools.
        - For Python projects, ensure all dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` are installed, and include additional packages if needed (e.g., live-reload tools like `watchdog`).
        - For Node.js projects, verify that `package.json` dependencies are correctly installed, and ensure the proper live-reload tool (like `nodemon`) is configured.
    - For **incorrect commands** in `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` (e.g., the `python -m watchdog` error), update the command to correctly invoke the application or relevant live-reload tool (e.g., use `watchmedo` for Python or `nodemon` for Node.js).
    - If the error involves **file or path issues** (e.g., `FileNotFound` or `PermissionDenied`), ensure that the Dockerfile is correctly copying the necessary files and setting the right working directory (`WORKDIR`).

3. **Update the `compose.yaml` Based on Errors**:
    - For **volume mounting issues**, ensure that only the required files and directories are mounted. Exclude directories like `node_modules` or `.venv` to prevent overwriting dependencies inside the container.
    - For **network or service dependency issues**, ensure that the `compose.yaml` correctly defines the necessary services and network configurations to avoid connection errors between containers.
    - Verify that **environment variables** and **ports** are properly configured if the error indicates issues with environment settings.

4. **Test and Validate**:
    - After updating the Dockerfile and `compose.yaml`, rebuild the Docker image to verify that the build completes without errors.
    - Ensure that the application starts correctly in the container using the appropriate `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` command.
    - Test that the container handles live updates correctly if applicable (e.g., using a tool like `watchmedo` or `nodemon` to monitor for changes and restart the application).
    - Ensure there are no errors related to missing packages, incorrect paths, or misconfigured environment variables once the container is running.

5. **Optimization** (Optional):
    - If the error relates to performance or inefficiency (e.g., long build times or large image sizes), suggest optimizations to the Dockerfile, such as using multi-stage builds, caching dependencies effectively, or reducing the number of layers.
